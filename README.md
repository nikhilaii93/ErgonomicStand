# ErgonomicStand

The stand uses 5 mm ABS sheets, with 2.5 mm Stainless Steel Rod Hinges. 2.5 mm Radius dimples on the sheets help hold the sheets in place perpendicular to each other. The materials used allow a greater tolerance and endurance to wear and tear of the product due to rough usage. The stand has a height of 40 cm adjustable up to 50 cm, allowing maximum area coverage by the camera from a variety of smartphones with varying camera resolutions. The stand is also fitted with LEDs to light the area being scanned. The entire product can be folded to a maximum width of 40 mm allowing easy portability.
5 mm thickness would ensure that the stand is strong and not becomes unsteady after some usage or accidental drops.
